# Swiggy-Bangalore-Outlet-Analysis
This project analyzes restaurant data from Swiggy's Bangalore outlets to uncover trends in delivery ratings, cost, cuisines, and location-based performance. I used Python for data analysis and visualization to generate business insights useful for food delivery platforms or restaurant partners.
I have tried to visualized key metrics (e.g., average cost, affordable restaurants, expensive and cheapest restaurants, ratings by location) using Seaborn and Matplotlib.
Generated actionable insights such as top-rated locations, average cost by cuisine, top-rated restaurants and relation between ratings and cost prices.
